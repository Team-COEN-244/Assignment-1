Assignment - 1 - COEN 244
Environment : Visual Studio 2019

This program contains one header file named Rational.h with the methods of the class in a cpp file named Rational.cpp
The main function is written in the Assignment_1.cpp and a little tester is also written (named tester.cpp)
The program askes the user to put yes or no if he / she wants to make different calculations with rational numbers.
If the user puts yes, the program continues, if he / she puts no, the program will end. If the user writes none of both, the program asks him / her to write yes or no. The error message still appear until the user writes yes / no.
The user can then put all the integers as he / she wants (it can be positive, negative, very large or very small). However, the denominator cannot be 0 and the number has to be an integer (if not, the program will take all the numbers before the coma as if it were an integer).
The program prints out then the addition, substraction, multiplication and division of the two rational numbers the user wrote.
The program, before ending, askes the user if he / she wants to do more calculations and put other numbers.
If the user does not write stop, the program does not end.
